# Logistic Regression

For the programming notebook this week, we'll implement Logistic regression and try to predict whether a person survived the sinking of the Titanic.

Download the Jupyter notebook on Logistic Regression [here](Logistic Regression.ipynb). You will also need the dataset containing passenger data of the Titanic, which you can download [here](titanic.csv).
