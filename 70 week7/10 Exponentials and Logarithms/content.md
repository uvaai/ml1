# Exponentials and Logarithms

This week's first topic is exponentials and logarithms. These functions in some
way are eachother's opposites and have some interesting properties which will
come to light in the second topic if this week; differentiation. Not only will
this help you get another step further in mathematics, exponentials and
logarithms and their differentials are also a fundamental part of the
Logistic Regression model.

Complete chapters 7.a Exponentials and Logarithms and 7.b Further rules for
Differentiation.
