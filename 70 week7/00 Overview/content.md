# Week 7

This week we'll take a look at Logistic Regression. Logistic Regression is a
method that is used to model the probability of an input being
part of a certain class. Understanding Logistic Regression is a big step towards
understanding how Neural networks function.

This week's [SOWISO module](/week7/exponentials-and-logarithms) topics are
exponentials, logarithms, and differentiation. Exponentials are an essential
part of transforming inputs into a probability in Logistic Regression, while
logarithms are used in its cost function. Differentiation of these terms is
very important when determining the gradient used in gradient descent.

Then, we'll continue with [videos by Andrew Ng](/week7/logistic-regression)
videos on Logistic Regression, as well as a recap on feature scaling,
which is an essential part of this week's
[programming notebook](/week7/shipwreck-survival). In the notebook, you will
take on the task of predicting whether a person survived the Titanic shipwreck
using Logistic Regression, doing all the preparation of the data yourself.

Finally, this week's [written assignment](/week7/automation-and-labour) will
discuss the claim that AI willcause massive unemployment in the future.
