    "# Logistic Regression - Predicting shipwreck survival\n",
    "\n",
    "In this week's assignment you will implement a classification algorithm named Logistic Regression. This sounds very counter-intuitive, as regression is something entirely different than classification, but the Logistic Regression model is actually estimating (\"regressing\") the probability (which is a continuous value) that data can be assigned to a specific class out of a set of classes. We will focus on so-called binary classification problems, wherein there are two possible classes. Some of the examples of binary classification problems that Logistic Regression is able to solve are: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Email; spam or not spam \n",
    "- Online transactions; fraud or not fraud\n",
    "- Tumor; malignant or benign \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will be using the classic *Titanic* dataset. This data consists of demographic and traveling information for 891 of the Titanic's passengers, and the ultimate goal is to predict which of these passengers survived. Here is a summary of the data set's attributes:\n",
    "- PassengerId: passenger ID assigned in this dataset\n",
    "- Survived: A Boolean indicating whether the passenger survived or not (0 = No; 1 = Yes); this is our target\n",
    "- Pclass: Passenger class (1 = 1st; 2 = 2nd; 3 = 3rd)\n",
    "- Name: field containing the name and title of the passenger\n",
    "- Sex: male/female\n",
    "- Age: age of the passenger in years\n",
    "- SibSp: number of siblings/spouses aboard\n",
    "- Parch: number of parents/children aboard\n",
    "- Ticket: ticket number\n",
    "- Fare: passenger fare in British Pounds\n",
    "- Cabin: location of the cabin, consisting of a letter indicating the deck, and a cabin number.\n",
    "- Embarked: port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can probably see, the dataset contains a mix of textual, continuous, categorical, and Boolean variables. Before we can get into implementing and applying Logistic Regression, we will have to clean up the data. We will lead you through this process using the tools a data-scientist might use, providing you with the tools that will help you quickly prepare your own data in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code below, we have loaded the data and show its first few rows."

We will discuss this later.\n",

One could say that the absence of information is also information, but in our case there is no way that our model can calculate a prediction when one of the input variables is absent. When you encounter missing values, you have multiple options for dealing with these missing values: you can delete each row that contains a missing values, you can delete the whole column from the DataFrame, or you can replace the missing values. In our case, deleting the rows would not be an option, as we already do not have a lot of data, and we need as much as possible to create an accurate model. Deleting the column would also not be an option, as the age of a person will probably be a good indicator for whether a person survived or not. The third option, replacing the missing values is good, but we have to find a method that will not skew our results. \n",

As replacing the values randomly will probably create a lot of outliers and will probably result in our model not being able to learn what correlations there are within the data, we will use a method that replaces missing values with values that are as generic as possible. An easy way to do this is to replace all missing values with a value that is inferred from the data that is available.\n",

    "Then, write some code that can plot the results for the logistic function between $-5$ and $5$. Use Numpy's [`np.linspace`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.linspace.html?highlight=linspace#numpy.linspace) to generate a range of $z$ values and use your `logistic_func` to calculate the corresponding $g$ values. Can you see why this function is also sometimes called the *Sigmoid* function? (The term \"sigmoid\" means S-shaped.)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint:* Numpy built-in functions and basic arithmetic operations work on both Numpy arrays and single values. When the function detects that its input is a Numpy array, the operation it applies will be applied to each element in the array seperately, the result being a Numpy array of the same shape as the input. This is called *element-wise application*. Write your `logistic_func` in such a way that it can compute $g$ values for scalars or for entire vectors."

    "This plot shows that the four most important variables are the Passenger Class, the Fare the passenger paid in pounds, whether the person is a male, and whether the person embarked in Southampton. Passenger class is negatively correlated, which means that a being in a higher passenger class results in a lower chance of survival. Paying more fare results in a higher probability of survival. While it is dangerous to draw conclusions from this plot, we might form some theories on why this is the case. One such theory would be that due to the \"Children and females first\" rule the chance of surviving while being a male is lower. Another unrelated theory could be that people who are in first class (and thus paid a higher fare) were on decks that were closer to the top of the boat, where the lifeboats were positioned, and thus had a higher chance of getting to a lifeboat in time."

    "Again, there is a clear correlation here. As someone in first class, there was a ~60% chance of survival. The difference with second class is not very large, but the difference for third class passengers is very apparent. While the number of people that were in first and second class were almost equal, the number of people in third class is comparatively very large. We can see that people in third class had a very low rate of survival. \n",

    "Taking a look into how and when the accident happened, we can also conclude why this was the case. The Titanic hit an iceberg at 11:40 p.m. ship's time, which meant that most people were sleeping in their cabins at the time of the incident. People were initially instructed to stay in their cabins, and by the time it was evident that the ship was actually going to sink, some of the lifeboats had already been launched even though they were only partially loaded. Although Titanic had advanced safety features, such as watertight compartments and remotely activated watertight doors, it only carried enough lifeboats for 1,178 people — about half the number on board. Many of the third class passengers were unable to get into a lifeboat, and when the boat broke apart and sank at 2:20 a.m. there were still well over one-thousand people aboard. Just under two hours after Titanic sank, the liner RMS Carpathia arrived, which took the surviving people from the lifeboats and the icecold water aboard.\n",

    "When building models, it is always important to take your time to analyse the data properly. Many times, aspects of the data, such as how, when, or under what circumstances it was gathered may have influenced it greatly. Using these aspects of the data into advantage may result in a model that is more accurate. Below, we have included a final boxplot that shows one of the improvements that can possibly be made to our data cleaning. We have inferred the missing data in the Age column by taking the average age of all passengers, but it might be better to infer the age of a passenger by taking the passenger class averages."
