# Week 2

This week, you will start by reading chapters 4, 5, and 6 of the online course ["Elements of AI"](https://www.elementsofai.com/) where you will learn about the different types of machine learning, neural networks, and implications of AI. This will set you up with a general idea of the topics we will discuss in this course and future courses.

You will then learn about types of data, frequency distributions, and measures of central tendency on SOWISO. These chapters will help you better understand data and its properties.

Finally, you will watch some more theory videos on Nearest Neighbours (NN), and implement an extension of NN in the shape of k-NN classification yourself in Python.
