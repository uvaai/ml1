# Week 2

This week, you'll continue the online course [Elements of AI](/week2/elements-of-ai),
where you will learn about the different types of machine learning, neural
networks, and implications of AI. This should give you a general idea of
some of the topics we will discuss in this course and future courses, before we
dive into the details more.

Next, you'll learn about types of data, frequency distributions, and measures
of central tendency on [SOWISO](/week2/types-of-data). This chapter should
help you better understand data and its properties, and get you started with
some of the concepts we'll use in the coming weeks.

Finally, you will watch some more theory videos on [Nearest Neighbours](/week2/nearest-neighbours)
(NN), and implement the [k-NN classification](/week2/k-nn-classification)
algorithm yourself in Python.
