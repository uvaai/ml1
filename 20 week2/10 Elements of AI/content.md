# Elements of AI

This week we will continue with the chapters 4, 5, and 6 of the [Elements of AI](https://www.elementsofai.com/)
course, completing the introduction to AI.

Read the material in these three chapters and complete the corresponding
exercises.

There are 4 open questions in these chapters, your answers to which you should
submit as your written assignment for the week. Specifically, you should submit
your answers for

* Chapter 4-2 : Exercise 15
* Chapter 6-1 : Exercise 23
* Chapter 6-2 : Exercise 24
* Chapter 6-3 : Exercise 25

### Peer review

For this week, you should again swap writing assignments with other students,
read them and share feedback with each other, both on the contents of the
arguments and the structure of the writing.

In addition to the Elements of AI answers you wrote for this week, you should
read the written assignments from at least 3 other students from last week
(Turing's article). You can form your own groups for this, sharing the
assignments you submitted among yourselves. Read the other assignments and
discuss anything that might be unclear, that you disagree on or maybe just
arguments you found interesting. Then, answer the following questions.

**Q1. Which students' assignments did you read?**

**Q2. What were the Turing arguments they objected too?**

**Q3. If there were any students that chose the same argument from Turing as
you did, were any counter arguments mentioned that you did not include? If so,
what were they?**

**Q4. If there were any students that chose a different argument from Turing
than you did, were any of the counter arguments mentioned suprising or
particularly insightful to you? If so, what were they?**

**Q5. Did reading all these arguments and counter arguments change your opinion
on whether or not the Turing test is an effective measure for intelligence? If
so, why? If not, why not?**
