# Elements of AI

This week we will continue with the chapters 4, 5, and 6 of the [Elements of AI](https://www.elementsofai.com/)
course, completing the introduction to AI.

Read the material in these three chapters and complete the corresponding
exercises.

There are 4 open questions in these chapters, your answers to which you should
submit as your written assignment for the week. Specifically, you should submit
your answers for

* Chapter 4-2 : Exercise 15
* Chapter 6-1 : Exercise 23
* Chapter 6-2 : Exercise 24
* Chapter 6-3 : Exercise 25

#### Peer review

You are encouraged to swap writing assignments with other students, read them
and share feedback with each other, both on the contents of the arguments and
the structure of the writing. Writing a good text can be difficult and,
especially after you rewrote something a couple of times, other people will
generally see improvements that you can't spot anymore. So, make use of that
and help each other out by exchanging feedback.

*Note:* This means swapping assignments with a student from the class, not
the peer review feature on the *Elements of AI* website.
