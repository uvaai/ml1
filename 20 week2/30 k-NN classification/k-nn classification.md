## Reminder: Getting started

In your terminal, navigate to the directory where you placed the file for the assignment and run the command

    jupyter notebook

This will print some information about the *Notebook* server in your console, and open a web browser to the URL of the web application. By default this is [http://127.0.0.1:8888](http://127.0.0.1:8888). Note that *127.0.0.1* is the home ip-adress, so this is now a webpage running on your own computer!

This first page shows the dashboard, which lists the notebooks available in the current directory. You can create new notebooks from the dashboard with the `New` button (select *Python 3* notebook), or open existing ones. Creating a new notebook will create a new file `Untitled1.ipynb`. The extension `.ipynb` indicates it is a notebook file, you can rename the file to something more descriptive at the top of the page.
