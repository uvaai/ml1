# Nearest Neighbours

The video below will recap the nearest neighbours algorithm, and expand it to
the common k-Nearest Neighbour algorithm. The programming assignment this week
will be to implement k-NN yourself. 

*Note:* You only need to watch **the first 13 minutes** of this video.

### Introduction on Vectors

This next video is on *vectors*, the fundamental components in *linear
algebra*. The topic will not be needed for the programming this week, but will
come up several times in the next couple of modules, so this quick introduction
will be useful. We will go into much more detail on linear algebra in a few
weeks, when we'll use some of the tools of linear algebra to implement
other algorithms, but for now we'll just get familiar with the basic concept.
