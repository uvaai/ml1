# Week 2

This week, you will start by reading chapters 4, 5, and 6 of the online course ["Elements of AI"](https://www.elementsofai.com/) where you will learn about the different types of machine learning, neural networks, and implications of AI.

You will then learn about types of data, frequency distributions, and measures of central tendency on SOWISO.

Then, you will implement k-NN classification yourself in Python.

Finally, you will read the second part of Turing's article on the Turing test.
