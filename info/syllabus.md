# Introduction to Machine Learning 1

University of Amsterdam / Programming Lab / 50821ITM6Y

## Staff

Tim Doolan (coordinator)

Wouter Vrielink (teacher)

You can reach us at <minorai@mprog.nl> for any practical matters or other
questions.

## Course content

This course consists of 8 modules. Each of these modules is expected to take 1
week and will focus on exploring one or more techniques from machine learning.
In general, there will be 4 components to each module:

* **Theory videos:** These will mostly introduce the required machine learning concepts for the topics that week.
* **SOWISO:** An online platform we'll use to cover foundational mathematical concepts that are the driving force behind a lot of the algorithms we'll explore.
* **Programming Notebook:** Here you will implement some of the machine learning algorithms yourself in *Python*.
* **Written Assignment:** Here you'll read articles or blog posts related to the philosophical and societal implication of ML, and answer questions about them.

Log in with your UvAnetID and create an account to get access to the modules.

## Deadlines

All assignments in a module should be handed in each week by *Sunday 23:59*.

If you think you will not make a deadline, send us an email *before* the
deadline has expired, so we can try to find a suitable solution. 

## Asking questions

If you have any question about the material, there are several ways to get
assistance.

1. If you have a question on a topic that might be useful for other students
too, you can post it on the [Ed forum](https://us.edstem.org/courses/487/) and
we will answer publicly there. This should already be familiar from
the *Programming 1 and 2* courses.
2. If you have a very specific question or something that would require sharing
a large portion of your solution, you can email us at <minorai@mprog.nl> or ask
a private question on Ed. We will then answer your directly question or
schedule a Zoom meeting to take a look at your problem together.
3. We will also host Zoom conferences with all students at least once a week.
These will mainly be to see how everyone is progressing, what parts are hard or
easy, and to give you a chance to ask other questions you have or want to
discuss with the group.

We would like to emphasise that you can (and should) ask questions if *any*
part of the material is unclear, not just if you get stuck with the programming
assignments. This specifically includes the material covered SOWISO chapters
and theory videos, and discussions on ideas covered in the articles are also
encouraged. Questions on all these topics and about the material in *Scientific
Programming 2* can be posted on the [Ed forum](https://us.edstem.org/courses/487/).

## Passing the course

The programming and writing assignment will both be graded on a 1 to 10 scale.
and at the end of the course an average for both these elements will be
computed. The SOWISO exercises have automatic feedback, so they will only be
graded on a *pass/fail* basis. Completing all the chapters is required in order
to recieve a pass for this element.

If all elements are completed satisfactorily, your final grade for the course
is computed as:

    30% programming average + 30% written average + 40% exam grade

More information on the exam will be announced later in the course, as we are
still waiting for *College van Bestuur* recommendations on how to proceed with
online examination.

## Academic honesty

This course's philosophy on academic honesty is best stated as "be reasonable." The course recognizes that interactions with classmates and others can facilitate mastery of the course's material. However, there remains a line between enlisting the help of another and submitting the work of another. This policy characterizes both sides of that line.

The essence of all work that you submit to this course must be your own. Collaboration on problem sets is not permitted except to the extent that you may ask classmates and others for help so long as that help does not reduce to another doing your work for you. Generally speaking, when asking for help, you may show your code to others, but you may not view theirs, so long as you and they respect this policy's other constraints. Collaboration on the course's test and quiz is not permitted at all.

Below are rules of thumb that (inexhaustively) characterize acts that the course considers reasonable and not reasonable. If in doubt as to whether some act is reasonable, do not commit it until you solicit and receive approval in writing from the course's heads. Acts considered not reasonable by the course are handled harshly.

### Reasonable

- Communicating with classmates about problem sets' problems in English (or some other spoken language).

- Discussing the course's material with others in order to understand it better.

- Helping a classmate identify a bug in his or her code at office hours, elsewhere, or even online, as by viewing, compiling, or running his or her code, even on your own computer.

- Incorporating a few lines of code that you find online or elsewhere into your own code, provided that those lines are not themselves solutions to assigned problems and that you cite the lines' origins.

- Reviewing past semesters' quizzes and solutions thereto.

- Sending or showing code that you've written to someone, possibly a classmate, so that he or she might help you identify and fix a bug.

- Sharing a few lines of your own code online so that others might help you identify and fix a bug.

- Turning to the course's heads for help or receiving help from the course's heads during the quiz or test.

- Turning to the web or elsewhere for instruction beyond the course's own, for references, and for solutions to technical difficulties, but not for outright solutions to problem set's problems or your own final project.

- Whiteboarding solutions to problem sets with others using diagrams or pseudocode but not actual code.

- Working with (and even paying) a tutor to help you with the course, provided the tutor does not do your work for you.

### Not Reasonable

- Accessing a solution to some problem prior to (re-)submitting your own.

- Asking a classmate to see his or her solution to a problem set's problem before (re-)submitting your own.

- Decompiling, deobfuscating, or disassembling the staff's solutions to problem sets.

- Failing to cite (as with comments) the origins of code or techniques that you discover outside of the course's own lessons and integrate into your own work, even while respecting this policy's other constraints.

- Giving or showing to a classmate a solution to a problem set's problem when it is he or she, and not you, who is struggling to solve it.

- Looking at another individual's work during the test or quiz.

- Paying or offering to pay an individual for work that you may submit as (part of) your own.

- Providing or making available solutions to problem sets to individuals who might take this course in the future.

- Searching for or soliciting outright solutions to problem sets online or elsewhere.

- Splitting a problem set's workload with another individual and combining your work.

- Submitting (after possibly modifying) the work of another individual beyond the few lines allowed herein.

- Submitting the same or similar work to this course that you have submitted or will submit to another.

- Submitting work to this course that you intend to use outside of the course (e.g., for a job) without prior approval from the course's heads.

- Turning to humans (besides the course's heads) for help or receiving help from humans (besides the course's heads) during the quiz or test.

- Viewing another's solution to a problem set's problem and basing your own solution on it.
