You can reach us at <minorai@mprog.nl> for any practical matters or other
questions.

## Course content

This course consists of 8 modules. Each of these modules is expected to take 1
week and will focus on exploring one or more techniques from machine learning.
In general, there will be 4 components to each module:

* **Theory videos:** These will mostly introduce the required machine learning concepts for the topics that week.
* **SOWISO:** An online platform we'll use to cover foundational mathematical concepts that are the driving force behind a lot of the algorithms we'll explore.
* **Programming Notebook:** Here you will implement some of the machine learning algorithms yourself in *Python*.
* **Written Assignment:** Here you'll read articles or blog posts related to the philosophical and societal implication of ML, and answer questions about them.

Log in with your UvAnetID and create an account to get access to the modules.

## Passing the course

The programming and writting assignments should be handed in each week by
*Sunday 23:59*. If you think you will not make a deadline, send us an email
*before* the deadline has expired, so we can try to find a suitable solution. 

Both these weekly assignments will be graded on a 1 to 10 scale and at the end
of the course an average for your programming assignments and written
assignments will be computed. The SOWISO exercises have automatic feedback, so
they will only be graded on a *pass/fail* basis. Completing all the chapters is
required in order to recieve a pass for this element.

If all elements are completed satisfactorily, your final grade for the course
is computed as:

    30% programming average + 30% written average + 40% exam grade

More information on the exam will be announced later in the course, as we are
still waiting for *College van Bestuur* recommendations on how to proceed with
online examination.

## Asking questions

If you have any question about the material, there are several ways to get
assistance.

1. If you have a question on a topic that might be useful for other students
too, you can post it on the *Ed* forum and we will answer publicly there. This 
should already be familiar from the *Programming 1 and 2* courses.
2. If you have a very specific question or something that would require sharing
a large portion of your solution, you can email us directly at <minorai@mprog.nl>.
We will then answer your question or schedule a Zoom meeting to take a look at
your problem together.
3. We will also host Zoom conferences with all students at least once a week.
These will mainly be to see how everyone is progressing, what parts are hard or
easy, and to give you a chance to ask other questions you have or want to
discuss with the group.

We would like to emphasise that you can (and should) ask questions if *any*
part of the material is unclear, not just if you get stuck with the programming
assignments. This specifically includes the material covered SOWISO chapters
and theory videos, and discussions on ideas covered in the articles are also
encouraged.
