# K-means

For the programming notebook this week, we'll implement the k-means clustering
algorithm. We'll start with a more thorough introduction on Numpy, as we'll be
needing it a lot this module when implementing k-means. 

Download the Jupyter notebook on Numpy [here](data/k_means.ipynb). Make sure
to do this introduction first, as it will cover things needed both for ML1 and
PDP later in the module.

Download  Jupyter notebook on k-means [here](data/k_means.ipynb). This will
be the main programming assignment for this module.
