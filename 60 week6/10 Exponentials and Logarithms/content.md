# Exponentials and Logarithms

This week's first topic is exponentials and logarithms. These functions are
each other's inverse and have some interesting properties, which will come to
light in the second topic if this week; differentiation. The final SOWISO
topics will be correlation and covariance, which are essential for
understanding dependencies between different variables.

All of these topics actually complete the whole SOWISO introduction for the
minor. These are the last mathematical tools we'll introduce, however they
won't be needed until *Introduction to Machine Learning 2*. That course won't
have a SOWISO component, so we'll already introduce these last concepts here.

Complete chapters 6.a Exponentials and Logarithms, 6.b Further rules for
Differentiation and 6.c Correlation and Covariance on [SOWISO](https://uva.sowiso.nl/).
