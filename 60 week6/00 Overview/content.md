# Week 6

This week we'll take a look at an unsupervised learning method called k-means, and learn about different methods of calculating distance.

This week's [SOWISO module](/week6/sowiso) is comprised of two parts. The first part continues upon last week's vector chapter and introduces a method of calculating the *angle between two vectors* using the dot product. The second part covers the concepts of *covariance* and *correlation*.

Thereafter, we'll continue with some more [videos by Andrew Ng](/week6/kmeans-theory) covering the K-means algorithm and how to optimize its parameter. We will then implement the algorithm in the [programming notebook](/week6/kmeans-programming), where we will also invest some time in implementing and observing the effect of different distance metrics.

Finally, for the written assignment of this week, we'll [listen to a podcast on Filter Bubbles, Echo chambers, and polarisation](/week6/filter-bubbles) wherein Judith MÃ¶ller is interviewed.
