# Week 6

This week we'll take a look at an unsupervised learning, specifically at a
cluster method called k-means, and learn about different methods of calculating
distance.

This week's [SOWISO module](/week6/vector-distance) is comprised of two parts. The first
part continues upon last week's vector chapter and introduces a method of
calculating the angle between two vectors using the dot product. The second
part covers the concepts of covariance and correlation.

Next, we'll continue with some more [videos by Andrew Ng](/week6/unsupervised-learning)
introducing unsupervised learning and the K-means algorithm. We will then
implement k-means in the [programming notebook](/week6/k-means) and
take a look at some different ways to compute distance.

Finally, for the written assignment of this week, we'll listen to a podcast on
[filter bubbles](/week6/filter-bubbles).
