While indexing elements is identical for 1-D arrays and lists, with 2-D arrays this works a little differently.

The basic difference is you always use a single pair of `[]` brackets to index any array, and separate the different axes with a comma. This is easiest to see in an example"

    "# Using Numpy effectively\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to this point we've covered the very basics of Numpy, which was creating and modifying multidimensional arrays to store numerical data of the same type together. However, almost everything we've covered up to this point could have also been accomplished using (list of) lists, just the syntax was a little different. It is possible to use Numpy in this way, and it is important that you know how to, but in general you actually want to try and avoid treating Numpy arrays exactly like lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The intended way to use Numpy is to not work with for-loops and simple indices, but to try and write operations to work over whole vectors or matrices in a single step.** This does not mean your code shouldn't have for-loops at all, but certain steps become a lot easier when defined for a whole matrix instead of doing a computation for every element separately. Besides being easier to write, Numpy code that modifies a whole vector will usually be quite a bit faster than some equivalent code using an explicit for-loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if you want to use Numpy effectively, it is important to try and write code that operates on vectors instead of just using for-loops. This style of programming also called *vectorized code*, and there are several different ways you can achieve this. You've already used one method extensively in the previous module, namely using matrix multiplication to compute some result for a whole matrix of data in single multiplication. The next part of this introduction will cover some other common Numpy methods you can use to write vectorized code.\n",
    "\n",
    "As it can take some getting used to writing this style of code, we'll also include some practical tips on writing vectorized code. The `checkerboard()` function you just wrote was completely unvectorized, as the steps for each cell were repeated using two for-loops, but we already came across our first useful tip\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Numpy Tip 1:  Test every step separately using simple inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "Build every step of any Numpy function incremently, testing to make sure each part works before moving on to the next part. Writing vectorized code can take some getting used to and can sometimes produce unexpected results, which can be hard to debug. Even more than with regular Python, it is important to separately check every line does what you expect. Start by writing some simple example inputs for your function which you can use to test each part. These example inputs should be small enough that you can check the results by hand, as testing directly on a large data matrix is a lot harder to verify.\n"

From there we worked backwards to the boolean indexing that could be used to perform that assignment, and ended up at just creating an integer array with all the indices so we could use that to create the boolean array required for the indexing. Creating this integer index array them became the first actual step when writing the code.\n"

Writing a function to create such a matrix will of course also give you some more practice with creating vectorized code.\n",

So there is always exactly one value in a row that is *on* (or *hot*), and all the others are *off* (or *cold*), which is why it is called a *one-hot encoding*.\n",

Once you have the vectorized code for that row/column, from there you can look at ways to expand this operation to vectorize the whole matrix in a single step. Note that this might not always be possible, but in that case you can still just repeat your vectorized code in a loop for each row or column.\n",

    "Writing vectorized code does not mean not using any for-loops at all, but just trying to minimize how many loops you write. If you cannot find a way to vectorize something, writing a loop is a good solution. Starting with a vectorized row and repeating this row solution in a loop still removes one loop from the traditional double for-loop to fill a matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether you choose to start from the rows or columns will usually depend on the specific matrix you're trying to vectorize. Sometimes there is an obvious choice and sometimes either option might work. For the `categorical_to_one()` function the later is the case, so you can start vectorizing from either the rows or the columns."
