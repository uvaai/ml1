# Numpy

We'll start this module with a more thorough introduction on Numpy, as we'll be
needing it for several assignments.

Download the Jupyter notebook on Numpy [here](data/numpy.ipynb).

*Make sure to do this introduction first, as it will cover things needed both for
ML1 and PDP later in the module.*
