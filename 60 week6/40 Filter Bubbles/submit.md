# Filter Bubbles

For the written assignment this week, listen to the
*Stuk Rood Vlees* podcast on [Filter Bubbles, Echo chambers, and
polarisation](https://soundcloud.com/stukroodvlees/aflevering-51-filterbubbels-echokamers-en-polarisatie-met-judith-moller),
wherein communications scientist Judith Möller is interviewed on the topics of
her research *(note this podcast is in Dutch, alternative sources in English
are listed at the end of the assignment)*. Then, answer the following questions
about the podcast:

1. Explain the difference between a filter bubble and a fringe bubble (the new
research topic Möller describes at the end of the podcast).
2. How does the effect of a fringe bubble on the opinion of the person in the
bubble differ from that of a person in a filter bubble?
3. Möller states that filter bubbles do not really occur in Dutch media. Do you
think it is likely that fringe bubbles do exist? Explain your answer.
4. Möller lists several reasons why filter bubbles can't really exist in
Holland. Why do or don't (depending on your answer for 3) you think that these
apply to fringe bubbles too?

Your assignment should be long enough to make a clear and cohesive argument for
your point of view. In general, this tends to correspond with around 500 words. 
The minimum requirement for the assignment is 350 words.


#### Peer review

You are encouraged to swap writing assignments with other students, read them
and share feedback with each other, both on the contents of the arguments and
the structure of the writing. Writing a good text can be difficult and,
especially after you rewrote something a couple of times, other people will
generally see improvements that you can't spot anymore. So, make use of that
and help each other out by exchanging feedback.


### Alternative sources in English

As the podcast for this assignment is in Dutch, students who only speak English
should base their writing assignment on these alternate sources:

* In this short interview for the UvA newsletter Judith Möller outlines her 
new research topic, following a very similar line as in the conclusion of the
podcast: [Do algorithms make us even more radical?](https://www.uva.nl/en/shared-content/faculteiten/en/faculteit-der-maatschappij-en-gedragswetenschappen/news/2020/01/algorithms-radical.html)

* This chapter from the book *The Routledge Companion to Media Disinformation
and Populism* covers a lot of the terminology and research on these topics in
more detail: [Filter bubbles and digital echo chambers.](data/chapter8.pdf)

* This report is about the degree to which filter bubbles are likely to exist
in the Netherlands. The section starting from *page 7* goes into the different
factors that might make filter bubbles more or less likely: [Filter bubbles in the Netherlands?](data/Filter-bubbles-in-the-Netherlands.pdf)
