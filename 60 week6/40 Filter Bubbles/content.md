# Filter Bubbles

For the written assignment this week, listen to the
*Stuk Rood Vlees* podcast on [Filter Bubbles, Echo chambers, and
polarisation](https://soundcloud.com/stukroodvlees/aflevering-51-filterbubbels-echokamers-en-polarisatie-met-judith-moller),
wherein communications scientist Judith Möller is interviewed on the topics of
her research. Then, answer the following question about the podcast:

1. Explain the difference between a filter bubble and a fringe bubble (the new
research topic Möller describes at the end of the podcast)
2. How does the effect of a fringe bubble on the opinion of the person in the
bubble differ from that of a person in a filter bubble?
3. Möller states that filter bubbles do not really occur in Dutch media. Do you
think it is likely that fringe bubbles do exist? Explain your answer.
4. Möller lists several reasons why filter bubbles can't really exist in
Holland. Why do or don't (depending on your answer for 3) you think that these
apply to fringe bubbles too?

### Peer review

For this week, you should again swap writing assignments with other students,
read them and share feedback with each other, both on the contents of the
arguments and the structure of the writing.

In addition to your answers on filter bubbles, you should read the written
assignments from at least 3 other students from last week (algorithmic bias).
You can form your own groups for this, sharing the assignments you submitted
among yourselves. Read the other assignments and discuss anything that might be
unclear, that you disagree on or maybe just arguments you found interesting.
Then, answer the following questions:

**Q1. Which students' assignments did you read?**

**Q2. Choose one assignment that covered a selection bias. Describe that
instance of selection bias very briefly.**

For any case of selection bias, the solution would almost always be to
get a more representative data set. Discuss the following question with the
student whose selection bias assignment you chose: How hard would it be to
collect a large volume of data that would be completely representative for the
problem covered in the article?

**Q3. Describe the data collection process you both came up with, which part of
the process ensures that this data will be representative, and any potential
difficulties or limitations.**

**Q4. Choose one assignment that covered a historic bias. Describe that
instance of historic bias very briefly.**

For any case of historic bias, a possible solution might be to simply
remove features on which you do not want your algorithm to distinguish, and
crucially, also remove other features that might contain indirect information
about those same features you want to remove, so the algorithm doesn't learn to
distinguish based on those proxy feature instead. Discuss with the student
whose historic bias assignment you chose: Which features would you expect to
have to remove from the data set? If you don't know which features are in the
data set, you can guess at what would reasonably be collected for that type of
problem.

**Q5. Describe the set of features you would remove and selection process you
came up with.**
