# Filter Bubbles

For the written assignment this week, listen to the
*Stuk Rood Vlees* podcast on [Filter Bubbles, Echo chambers, and
polarisation](https://soundcloud.com/stukroodvlees/aflevering-51-filterbubbels-echokamers-en-polarisatie-met-judith-moller),
wherein communications scientist Judith Möller is interviewed on the topics of
her research. Then, answer the following question about the podcast:

1. Explain the difference between a filter bubble and fringe bubble (the new
research topic Möller describes at the end of the podcast)
2. How does the effect of a fringe bubble on the opinion of the person in the
bubble differ from that of a person in a filter bubble?
3. Möller states that filter bubbles do not really occur in Dutch media. Do you
think it is likely that fringe bubbles do exist? Explain your answer.
4. Möller lists several reasons why filter bubbles can't really exist in
Holland. Why do or don't (depending on your answer for 3) you think that these
applies to fringe bubbles too?
