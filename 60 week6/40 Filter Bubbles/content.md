# Filter Bubbles, Echo Chambers, and Polarisation

A _filter bubble_ is a state of isolisation that can result from personalized presentation of information by an algorithm. The theory is that this algorithm selectively guesses what information a user would like to see based on the characteristics that it associates with that specific user. As this algorithm is the only gatekeeper of information for this user, users may become detached from opinions or standpoints that disagree with their own, effectively isolating them.

This term is not to be confused with the term _echo chamber_, as this is the description of a situation wherein beliefs are reinforced by information gained inside a closed system. By visiting an echo chamber, a user will only find information which reinforces their standpoints; these people become surrounded by those who acknowledge and follow the same beliefs.

Listen to the [Stuk Rood Vlees podcast on Filter Bubbles, Echo chambers, and polarisation](https://soundcloud.com/stukroodvlees/aflevering-51-filterbubbels-echokamers-en-polarisatie-met-judith-moller) wherein researcher Judith Möller is interviewed on the subject. Then, answer the following questions.

1. Explain the difference between a filter bubble and fringe bubble (the new research topic Moller describes at the end of the podcast)
2. How does the effect of a fringe bubble on the opinion of the person in the bubble differ from that of a person in a filter bubble?
3. Möller states that filter bubbles do not really occur in Dutch media. Do you think it is likely that fringe bubbles do exist?
4. Möller lists several reasons why filter bubbles can't really exist in Holland. Why do or don't (depending on your answer for 3) you think that these applies to fringe bubbles too?
