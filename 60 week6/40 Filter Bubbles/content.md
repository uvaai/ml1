# Filter Bubbles, Echo Chambers, and Polarisation

A _filter bubble_ is a state of isolisation that can result from personalized presentation of information by an algorithm. The theory is that this algorithm selectively guesses what information a user would like to see based on the characteristics that it associates with that specific user. As this algorithm is the only gatekeeper of information for this user, users may become detached from opinions or standpoints that disagree with their own, effectively isolating them.

This term is not to be confused with the term _echo chamber_, as this is the description of a situation wherein beliefs are reinforced by information gained inside a closed system. By visiting an echo chamber, a user will only find information which reinforces their standpoints; these people become surrounded by those who acknowledge and follow the same beliefs.
