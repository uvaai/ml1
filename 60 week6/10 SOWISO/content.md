# Vector Distances, Correlation, and Covariance

The first topic of this week is Vector Distances, which will help cement your knowledge on how vectors function and show you how the dot product of two vectors can be used to calculate the difference in angle between these vectors. The second topic of this week focusses on Correlation and Covariance, which are important subjects that can help you better understand what kind of data you are working with. The understanding of these topics will greatly assist you during the implementation and interpretation of the different distance metrics that we will cover in the programming homework.
