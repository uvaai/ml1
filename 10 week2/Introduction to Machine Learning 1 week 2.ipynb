    "**If you have not yet read and done the exercises of chapters 4-6 https://course.elementsofai.com/, please do so now.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Who is k-NN? Is it some underground band that is bringing a new sound with the banjo that lives next door? Steve Martin, watch out now. What is it? Does it make a pie better than [Patti LaBelle’s sweet potato pie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQRwFn7WPk8)? Well, no. \n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter 4.2 of https://course.elementsofai.com/ discussed the Nearest Neighbour (NN) classifier, wherein unclassified items are classified using the \"nearest\" known training-data-point's label. The k-NN classifier works very similarly; instead of using the single nearest known neighbour of an unknown datapoint, it uses the \"k\" nearest known neighbours and takes the most common class among those neighbours. Basically, with $k = 1$ k-NN would do the exact same as the NN classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following example where the test sample (green dot) should be classified either to blue squares or to red triangles:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of $k = 1$ k-NN would assign the test sample (green circle) to the class of red triangles, because the nearest other datapoint is a red triangle. If $k = 3$ (solid circle) it is assigned to the red triangles because there are 2 triangles and only 1 square inside the inner circle. If $k = 5$ (dashed circle) it is assigned to the blue squares (3 squares vs. 2 triangles inside the outer circle).\n",
    "\n",
    "Why or when would you use this? Well, there are times where data may be given that is anonymized and the goal is to attempt to classify it, without really knowing the context of the data. Think of grouping customer personalities to recommend specific products on websites like Amazon or AliExpress. \n",

    "## Nearest Neighbour\n",
    "\n",
    "First we will try to tackle the problem of finding the nearest neighbour. We will use the geometric distance (also known as straight-line distance, or Euclidean distance) to decide which is the nearest item. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Euclidean Distance\n",
    "\n",
    "The euclidean distance $d$ between point $p$ with coordinates $(p_x, p_y)$ and point $q$ with coordinates $(q_x, q_y)$ is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ d(p,q) = \\sqrt{(p_x - q_x)^2 + (p_y - q_y)^2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be read as; the straight-line distance between $p$ and $q$ is equal to the square root of the sum of squared differences in the $x$ and $y$ dimensions. (Which is still quite abstract).\n",
    "\n",
    "To make this more clear, consider the following example:\n",
    "\n",
    "![euclidean_distance.png](euclidean_distance.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Euclidean distance between point $p$ and $q$ is depicted as the blue line ($C$). As you can see, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem ($A^2 + B^2 = C^2$) to calculate the length of $C$. To do this, we first need the length of $A$ and $B$. The length of $A$ is equal to $(q_x - p_x)$, while the length of $B$ is equal to $(q_y - p_y)$. Now, applying the Pythagorean Theorem we end up with:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ C^2 = A^2 + B^2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ C = \\sqrt{A^2 + B^2} = \\sqrt{(p_x - q_x)^2 + (p_y - q_y)^2} = d(p,q)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we now define the $x$ and $y$ dimensions to be $1$ and $2$, we can even rewrite our formula for the distance like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ d(p,q) = \\sqrt{(p_1 - q_1)^2 + (p_2 - q_2)^2} $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Which can be rewritten more formally:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ d(p,q) = \\sqrt{\\sum^2_{i=1}(p_i - q_i)^2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "__Write a piece of code that calculates the Euclidean distance between two sets of coordinates (`p` and `q`) and stores the solution in the variable `distance`.__ Write it such that it works for any `p` and `q`, as you will need this code later.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Disclaimer; normally you would write functions to prevent duplicate code, but for this exercise \"copy and pasting\" code is okay. If, however, you would like to try to solve it using functions, you are free to do so.*"

A Voronoi diagram is a partition of a plane into regions determined by the datapoints.

This means that we can simply use Nearest Neighbour to determine our regions. The Voronoi diagram that results from our datapoints is shown below:\n",

Any point that is exactly on top of this line can not be classified by our NN algorithm.\n",

Since we have defined our two possible class-values as $-1$ and $1$, this can easily be done by just taking the sum of the class labels of our `neighbours`, and seeing if this value is negative, positive, or zero. When the value of this sum is negative, there were more points with the class-value of $-1$ than there were points with the class-value of $1$. When the value of this sum is positive, the opposite is the case. When the value is zero, there were just as many points with a class-value of $-1$ as there were points with a class-value of $1$.\n",
