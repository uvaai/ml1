# Week 3

This week we'll take a deeper dive into probability theory. We'll start with some
SOWISO exercises on [probability distributions](/week3/probability-distributions)
and after that, theory videos further introducing [Bayes' rule](/week3/bayes-rule),
one of the most important rules in probability theory.

Next, we'll apply all that theory in a *Naive Bayes* algorithm for the problem
of [sentiment analysis](/week3/sentiment-analysis) in the programming notebook.
Here we'll try to predict whether a tweet has a positive or a negative
tone, i.e. the sentiment of the tweet, using labelled data from Twitter.

Finally, we'll read Searle's paper describing the [Chinese room](/week3/chinese-room)
though experiment, and try to apply its ideas to the *Naive Bayes* program from
the notebook.
