# Week 3

This week we'll dive a lot more into probability theory. We'll start with some
theory videos on [Bayes' Rule](/week3/bayes-rule) and then practice with
[probability distributions](/week3/probability-distributions) on SOWISO.

Then we'll apply all that theory in a *Naive Bayes* algorithm for the problem
of [sentiment analysis](/week3/sentiment-analysis) in the programming notebook.
Here we'll try and predict if a tweet has a positive or negative
tone, i.e. the sentiment of the tweet, using labeled data from Twitter.

Finally, we'll read Searle's paper describing the [Chinese room](/week3/chinese-room)
though experiment and try to apply the ideas to the *Naive Bayes* program from
the notebook.
