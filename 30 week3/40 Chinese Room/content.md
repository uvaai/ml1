# Chinese Room

This week we’ll revisit the philosophical question from the written assignment
of the first week; “Can machines think?”, and try to relate it to the new
machine learning concepts you’ve learned in the past few weeks. For this we'll
read Searle’s article describing the Chinese Room thought experiment, which is
a classic text on the question. 

The main claim Searle makes in this article is that instantiating a computer
program is never by itself sufficient to produce intentionality, where
*intentionality* is the ability of the mind to form representations about
something, which is required to understand them. Simply put, he claims computer
programs by themselves can never produce understanding. Intentionality can be a
tricky concept, but Searle gives a lot of examples in his article of cases
where he thinks there are or aren't sufficient conditions for understanding.
Read the article and then answer the questions below.

## Understanding Sentiment

Searle never really gives an explicit definition of "understanding" and even
says in the article he wants to avoid fancy footwork around this definition.
Instead, he simply lists a lot of hypothetical examples using people and
machines, where he argues whether or not, in that specific example, these can
be said to have clear understanding of the information they are processing. For
this written assignment you'll be asked to make the same type of classification
(i.e. does or does not have understanding) for the examples listed below, and
to motivate these classifications using your own arguments.

1. Start your written assignment by giving your own opinion on Searle's article
and his classifications of understanding. Did Searle convince you with his
arguments regarding the capacity for a computer program to produce
understanding? Are there any examples Searle classifies as understanding / not
understanding you disagree with?

2. Consider the Naive Bayes sentiment analysis program you built in the
programming notebook this week as a new example potentially capable of
understanding. Would you argue this program has understanding of the
sentiment of the tweets it processes? Why or why not?
 
3. Then, consider the case where you yourself are reading tweets and
classifying the sentiment of each tweet as positive or negative. Argue whether
or not you think you have understanding of the sentiment of these tweets.

4. Next, consider the case where you are not trying to classify based on your
own understanding of sentiment, but instead are trying to reproduce the
specific notion of sentiment from the labels of the data set used in the
assignment. So, you are not trying to classify what you think of as having a
positive sentiment, but have read the data set and are trying to get your
classifications as close as possible to the labels of these 1.6 million sample
tweets. Argue whether or not you think you would have understanding of the
labeled sentiment of tweets in this data set.

5. Finally, consider a combined system, consisting of the Naive Bayes sentiment
analysis program and yourself, the programmer who wrote it. For this combined
system, you are able to interact with and inspect any intermediate results and
probabilities produced by the program when it makes a prediction for a new
tweet, so you can write code to access all of the data and calculations, and
not just the resulting prediction. Argue whether or not you think this combined
system would be able to produce understanding of the labeled sentiment of
tweets in the data set used in the assignment.

*Note:* Some of these examples might be hard to classify as having
understanding or not, and there isn't an obvious right or wrong answer for
these questions.  What is most important, is that your answers show you
understand the concepts from Searle's paper and how they might apply to
different solutions for the problem of sentiment analysis.

Your assignment should be long enough to make a clear and cohesive argument for
your point of view. In general, this tends to correspond with around 500 words. 
The minimum requirement for the assignment is 350 words.

#### Peer review

You are encouraged to swap writing assignments with other students, read them
and share feedback with each other, both on the contents of the arguments and
the structure of the writing. Writing a good text can be difficult and,
especially after you rewrote something a couple of times, other people will
generally see improvements that you can't spot anymore. So, make use of that
and help each other out by exchanging feedback.
