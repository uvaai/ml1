# Naive Bayes

For the programming notebook this week, we'll be applying all the probability
theory you've been studying to the problem of sentiment analysis, using a lot
of real data harvested from Twitter.

Download the data set [here](data/sentiment_data.zip) and programming notebook
[here](data/naive_bayes.ipynb). (Right-click >> Save Link As >> Type: All Files)

*Note:* The data set for this assignment is very large, which means some
computations can take a long time. Therefore, there are some precautions you
should take while working on this assignment:

* Make sure to close other programs on your computer which might use a lot of processing power or memory
* Do not print the contents of the whole data set or dictionary you're working with, as that will take a very long time

If any computation you run takes more than 2 minutes to complete, then
something is probably not working correctly. In that case, you should stop the
program and check your code. If you cannot find the problem, contact a TA for
help.
