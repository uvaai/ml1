# Linear Algebra

There will be a lot of different topics to introduce this week, but all of them
will be directly useful in the programming notebook. Writing larger linear
models actually becomes easier when you can use vectors and matrices, so they
will be main topic of the SOWISO module for this week. In addition, we'll
introduce a famous continuous probability distribution, called the Gaussian
Distribution. It can used to model many things, including modelling the noise a
data set, which is what we'll use it for this week.

To get an introduction on some of these topics, we'll start with some of the
videos from the Linear Algebra course on Khan Academy. Then, you can complete
the SOWISO chapters linked below. Start by watching the following videos:
