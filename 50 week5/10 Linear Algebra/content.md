# Linear Algebra

Writing complex linear models actually becomes easier when you can use vectors
and matrices, so they will be main topic of the SOWISO module for this week. In
addition, we'll introduce a famous continuous probability distribution, called
the Gaussian Distribution. It can used to model many things, including
modelling the noise a data set, which is what we'll use it for this week.
