# Linear Algebra

Writing complex linear models actually becomes easier when you can use vectors
and matrices, so they will be main topic of the SOWISO module for this week. In
addition, we'll introduce the Gaussian Distribution, a continuous probability
distribution we can use to model many things, including the noise a data set.
