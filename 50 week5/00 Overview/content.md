# Week 5

This week we'll work on vectorizing multivariate linear regression, and get
introduced to different kinds of *bias* and *variance*.

To start with, the [SOWISO module](/week5/linear-algebra) for this week has an
introduction in linear algebra, which is the tool used for vectorization. It
will also cover the *Gaussian* distribution and measuring the *variance* of a
data set.

Then we'll continue with some more [video lectures by Andrew Ng](/week5/multivariate-regression)
covering the topics of multivariate and polynomial regression. We'll build both
these algorithms in the [programming notebook](/week5/polynomial-regression),
where we'll also learn about the essential *bias-variance* trade-off.

Finally, for the written assignment this week, we'll discuss
[other types of bias](/week5/algorithmic-bias/) a learning algorithm might have
and the effects such biases can have on the problem the algorithm is intended
to solve.
