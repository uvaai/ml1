    "# Chatbots: ELIZA\n",
    "\n",
    "For this first assignment we'll take a look at some simple chatbots, and their sometimes seemingly human responses. We'll start with a demo of ELIZA, a chatbot created in the 60's by Joseph Weizenbaum at MIT. It was created to demonstrate the superficiality of communication between humans and machines, but Weizenbaum was surprised by the number of individuals who attributed humanlike feelings to the computer program. ELIZA is considered one of the first programs capable of attempting the Turing test.\n",
    "\n",
    "## NLTK Demo\n",
    "\n",
    "The ELIZA program is so classic that you can find many versions of it online. It also comes already included in `nltk`, a Natural Language ToolKit for Python. Natural language here means human language (as opposed to formal languages like programming languages) and being able to process and \"understand\" this has many applications in AI. A chatbot can be a good demonstration of some of these features, which is why it comes included.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ELIZA script is intended to simulate the role of a therapist trying to help you, as a patient. Try out the demo below and have a conversation with ELIZA. You can type `quit` to stop the conversations. Afterwards, answer the questions below.\n"

Make sure you've done this with the ELIZA cell above.\n",

There are only a few components needed, the first of which is a dictionary of *reflections*. Reflections are used to switch the language between first-person singular and second-person singular. So, for example, if you are talking with ELIZA about a dog and say \"my dog\", then there is a rule to switch this to \"your dog\" when responding.\n",
