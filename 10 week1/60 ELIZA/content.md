# ELIZA

For this first programming assignment you'll get to know ELIZA, a famous
computer psychotherapist, and write a simple chatbot of your own.

## Starting the assignment

The programming notebook for this week can be downloaded [here](data/Eliza.ipynb).
(Right-click >> Save Link As >> Type of file: All Files)

Navigate the terminal to the folder where you downloaded the assignment file.
To open the notebook, activate the `progLab` environment and start the notebook
server:

    conda activate progLab
    jupyter notebook

The assignment uses the `nltk` library, so without the environment this code
won't work!

*Note:* If you close and reopen the assignment notebook, then the `nltk`
imports and all the code you ran will no longer be in memory. You will have to
rerun all cells so all the imports are included again. You can use
`Cell > Run all` from the menu bar (at the top) to do this.

You can stop any active chats by typing `quit` in the chat box. You can also
comment out a chat by adding a `#` before, so the chatbot won't run. See the
section *Quitting the program* for more details.

## Completing your solution

Write the answers to the open questions directly in each of the *Markdown* cells.

Make sure any code you write has clear variable names and comments where needed.

**You can submit your files through the "Submit" tab at the top of this page.**
