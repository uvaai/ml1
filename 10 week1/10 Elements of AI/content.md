# Elements of AI

This week we will start with the first three chapters of the online course [Elements of AI](https://www.elementsofai.com/).
Elements of AI was created by the [University of Helsinki](https://www.helsinki.fi/)
and [Reaktor](https://www.reaktor.com/), and aims to demystify AI. It will
provide you with a quick overview of what AI really means, how AI is created,
how AI might affect your life, and how it will develop in the coming years.

### Getting Started

Register as a student on [the Elements of AI
website](https://course.elementsofai.com/). Read the first three chapters and
complete all of the corresponding exercises.

1. What is AI?
2. AI problem solving
3. Real world AI

At the end of Chapter 1-3 there is an open question in Exercise 4, on the
definition of AI. Make sure to *save your answer* to this question in a
separate file somewhere, as you will need to hand it in as part of your written
assignment for this week.

**You can submit your file using the submit tab on the "Turing's paper" page.**
