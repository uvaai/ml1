# Experimental Probability

Below are four videos by Salman Khan from the Khan Academy. These videos explain
the main difference between a theoretical probability, as covered in the
SOWISO chapter, and an experimental one, and how these both can be used in
predictions or simulations. There are no exercises associated with these
concepts this week, so for now just watch the videos.
