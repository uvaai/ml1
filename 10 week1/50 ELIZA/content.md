# ELIZA

For this first programming assignment you'll get to know ELIZA, a famous
computer psychotherapist, and write a simple chatbot of your own.

### Jupyter Notebooks

All programming assignment will be done in *Jupyter Notebooks*. The Scientific
Programming course, which you're also taking, has a short introduction
on notebooks. If you've not done so yet, complete the introduction in that
course, before continuing with this assignment here.

The programming notebook for this week can be downloaded [here](Eliza.ipynb)
(right-click and save).

Write the answers to the questions directly in each of the *Markdown* cells.
Make sure any code you write has clear variable names and comments where
needed.
