# ELIZA

For this first programming assignment you'll get to know ELIZA, a famous

Programming course, which you're also taking, has a short tutorials on
installing *Python* and running Notebooks. Follow these before you continue

the [instructions from SP1](https://sp1.mprog.nl/installing/on-your-own-computer).
* If you've not done so yet, complete the
[introduction on Notebooks](https://sp2.mprog.nl/complexity/notebook) in *SP2*.

Finally, make sure to install all requirements by downloading [this file](requirements.txt) and running the following command in the same folder:

    conda install --file requirements.txt
