# Theoretical Probability

This week we'll get started with some basic concepts of probability. For this
you should complete all the exercises in *Chapter 1. Probability*.

There are three subchapters this week: *Randomness*, *Relationship between Events*
and *Probability*, which will give you a more formal introduction into the
concepts and language used to describe the probability of events.

### SOWISO

All the fundamental mathematical material and exercises for this course will be
done in an online environment called SOWISO, which you may or may not already
be familiar with. In SOWISO you can read theory pages describing the concepts
and can get automated feedback and hints for each exercise.

**Note:** Make sure to set your language in SOWISO to English, some of the
modules will not be available in Dutch.
