# Theoretical Probability

This week we'll get started with some basic concepts of probability. For this
you should complete all the exercises in *Chapter 1. Probability*. There all 3
subchapters this week: *Randomness*, *Relationship between Events* and
*Probability*, which will give you a more formal introduction into the concepts
and language used to describe the probability of events.

### SOWISO

All the fundamental mathematical material and exercises for this course will be
done in an online environment called SOWISO, which you may or may not already
be familiar with. In SOWISO you can read theory pages describing the concepts
and can get automated feedback and hints for each exercise.

Currently, you will need to be manually added to the SOWISO module for this
course. This means you will need to log into SOWISO *first*, and then we can
add you to the course. Log into SOWISO using you UvAnetID here:

[https://uva.sowiso.nl](https://uva.sowiso.nl)

Then send us an email at *minorai@mprog.nl*, including your name and student
number, and we'll add you to the course. After that you can get started with
the exercises.

**Note:** Make sure to set your language in SOWISO to English, some of the
modules will not be available in Dutch.
