# Week 1

This week we'll start with a [general introduction](/week1/elements-of-ai) to
*Artificial Intelligence*, and learn what difference is between AI and
*Machine Learning*.

Next we'll dive more deeply into two other topics also covered in this
introduction, specifically using *Probability* to model uncertainty and
the using *Turing Test* as a measure of machine intelligence.

For the probability section, there will be a SOWISO chapter on
[Theoretical Probability](/week1/theoretical-probability), and a couple of
theory videos on [Experimental Probability](/week1/experimental-probability).

Finally, we'll read [Turing's paper](/week1/turing-test) describing his
proposed test, and take a look at programming a [simple chatbot](/week1/eliza)
that could try to pass this test.
